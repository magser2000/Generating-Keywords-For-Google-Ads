    "## 1. The Summary\n",
    "<p>Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, and the agency is approached by a massive discount retailer. They want to make sure analysts are proficient at making large campaigns for their website. The goal of this project is to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their athletics shoes department. The client says that they want us to generate keywords for the following products: </p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>trail shoes</li>\n",
    "<li>running shoes</li>\n",
    "<li>basketball shoes</li>\n",
    "<li>walking shoes</li>\n",
    "<li>cleats</li>\n",
    "<li>tennis shoes</ul>\n",
    "<p><strong>The Summary</strong>: Since the client is considered a low-cost retailer, they are offering many promotions and discounts. The analyst will need to focus on these keywords. They will also need to steer clear from keywords and topics that have to do with luxury, as their target customer is a price-sensitive customer. Because the company is also tight on budget, it would be most ideal to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match rather than matching a large range of words without an exact phrase match.</p>\n",
    "<p>Based on the summary above the analyst will first need to generate a list of words, that together with the products given above would make for good keywords. Here are some examples:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Products: trail shoes, running shoes, basketball shoes, walking shoes, cleats shoes, tennis shoes</li>\n",
    "<li>Words: buy, prices, promotion, promo, sale, discount, shop</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Here are some of the resulting keywords: 'buy shoes', 'shoes buy', 'discount shoes', 'shoes discount',\n",
    "              'buy basketball shoes', 'prices running shoes', 'prices walking shoes', 'cleat shoes', 'cleat prices', 'prices shoes', 'shoe prices' etc.</p>\n",
